# So-you-think-MDX-is-hard
Demo files for my "So you think MDX is hard?" presentation.

There are two files in this repository. 

So you think MDX is hard WWI.mdx is the sample MDX script seen during the presentation. It starts with the simpliest form of an MDX statement and builds up to creating calculated members and sets. 

WWI-SSASMD.abf.zip is the compressed backup of the WWI-SSASMD cube, which the script is run against. 

If you want the project files that built the cube, see the Wide World Importers SSAS MD project located in this repository at:
